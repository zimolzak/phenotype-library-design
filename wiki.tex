The MAVERIC wiki\footnote{http://vhabosapp8/wiki} was created in December
2010. It was evidently used a fair amount through October 2011.
Starting June 2014, usage has picked up again. The \texttt{vhabosapp8} server
hosts Subversion repositories and the Jira issue and project tracker
as well. Currently 13 out of 74 GB of space is free on
\texttt{vhabosapp8}.

\section{Problem/niche}

The Precision Oncology Project and the Point of Care Trials will rely 

Data pull and NLP teams intend to use the wiki to 

\section{Themes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Data Access and Secure Server Development
\item Model/algorithm development

\begin{itemize}
\item Communication
\item Documenting the process
\item Storing results
\end{itemize}

\item Model/algorithm management

\begin{itemize}
\item Storing metadata (DMR)
\item Storing models themselves
\item Model test/validation process (who signs off, on what?)
\item Storing model test and validation results
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Among others, this encompasses the wiki project as well as the data
pull request tracker. These projects originated as solutions to
existing problems, and both are hopefully approaching full roll-out
phase. As such, it may be important to have defined training
objectives and roll-out plans for each tool, so that they become
integrated into workflows, rather than remain as offshoot projects.
 
Next Wednesday's meeting will be abbreviated due to the CSPCC monthly
speaker event occurring at noon (topic is fraud in medical research,
should be very interesting), so we will only have time to talk at
length about one topic.
 
Andy and Ned, if you could have a recap of the changes that have
happened with the wiki project for next week, as well as your plans
for next steps with the project, I think that would be of general
interest to the members of this meeting.
 
There has also been some feedback regarding the name of this meeting,
since it does not directly pertain to ``data.'' One name proposal is
``Model/Algorithm environments meeting'' but I don't know if that is
too vague. Thoughts?

\section{About MediaWiki}

``A wiki is a Web application which allows people to add, modify, or
delete content in collaboration with
others.''\footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki} MediaWiki is the
software that makes Wikipedia run, but anyone can install it to their
Web server to create their own wiki. The \texttt{vhabosapp8} server
runs Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

\section{What has changed recently}

\paragraph{October 23--28} I created several standard templates that
can be used in multiple places, to avoid duplicating the same wikitext
code. These are mainly for Data Pull and NLP subsections of the wiki. 

\paragraph{October 29} Organize the Data Pull wiki page structure. 

\paragraph{October 30} Start using for ``POP Additional Documents''
and sodium.

\paragraph{November 5} Shadow wiki created.

\paragraph{November 6} Magnesium, ALT.

\paragraph{November 12} Shadow wiki becomes real wiki.

\paragraph{November 12--14} Magnesium, ALT, POP surgical procedures,
ALT, AST.

\section{Suggestions for you all in future}

Don't upload enormous things. Use talk pages. 

\section{Flaws in wiki}

Where does the actual SQL go? Here is what the current Data Pull
template looks like.
