\maketitle

Like essentially all VA studies that rely heavily on the Corporate
Data Warehouse, MVP must deal with the fact that data elements are
incompletely harmonized across the 130+ VA Medical Centers or
``stations,''\footnote{``[D]ata aggregation across the VHA is highly
  problematic, and data validity is often impossible to verify.''
  \emph{N Engl J Med} 373:1693--1695} although messy data is certainly
not unique to VA.\footnote{Example hemoglobin A1c units: ``\%, \%HB,
  \% A1C, MG/DL, G/DL, NULL, Blank, U.'' \emph{Pharmacoepidemiol Drug
    Saf.} 23(6):609--18.} Even when stations are forced to use the
same coding system nationwide (e.g.\ ICD diagnosis codes), we must
perform further work to determine the reliability of any combination
of data elements. \emph{Phenotype} is the term we use for a set of
harmonized data elements, or for a higher-order concept made of many
such ``building blocks.'' When a subject matter expert (SME), analyst,
statistician, and/or data pull engineer create a phenotype, the result
can be: SQL code that represents the SME's rules, a public database
table that represents the enumerated list of included\slash excluded
data items, or even a statistical model (comprising SAS or R or other
code, plus coefficients) of the likelihood of a patient having the
given phenotype.\footnote{Example phenotypes, which happen to be
  requirements from \emph{non-}MVP studies: Failed first-line
  platinum-containing chemotherapy. Urgent coronary revascularization
  (completed or attempted) because of unstable angina. Erectile
  dysfunction, defined as first prescription for PDE5 inhibitor or
  referral for ED.}

\section{What we can't do today}

Ideally, a robust phenotype library should exist, serving several
functions. I am deliberately steering clear of discussing \emph{how}
to serve each function and would rather leave that discussion for the
group.

(1) The library should make the products of each SME/data review
process \emph{available for viewing} by study coordinators, either by
searching, or by browsing an overview of all available phenotypes; and
these products should be \emph{available for immediate use} by study
analysts writing further analytic code. (2) The \emph{code} used in
the process of deriving a phenotype should be preserved, in part
because the scientific validity of a study's conclusions rests in part
on the phenotype code. (3) Phenotype and code \emph{metadata} (such as
responsible SME and data extractors, and date of creation) should be
clearly noted, to allow study staff to trust a phenotype, and to allow
phenotyping core personnel to renew elements over time. (4) The
library should \emph{document} the rationale for decisions made by
SME, analyst, etc., and the functioning of code, and it should allow
collaborative editing of this documentation. Documentation will
typically be in sentences and paragraphs.\footnote{E.g.\ ``[S]hould
  the ETL process be interrupted by any kind of database, host machine
  or connection issue\ldots{}, in order to protect data and avoid
  partial load the ETL will not re-execute itself and\ldots{}.''

\newpage

A central idea of functions (1)--(4) above is that the methods of
science should be available and documented well enough to be
reproducible---in other words, ``show your work.''\footnote{``[O]ur
  policy now mandates that when code is central to reaching a paper's
  conclusions, we require a statement describing whether that code is
  available and setting out any restrictions on accessibility.''
  \emph{Nature} 514:536, 2014-10-30} Often for our type of science,
\emph{code is method.}\footnote{sciencecodemanifesto.org}

\section{Wish list (a.k.a.\ thinking big)}

\paragraph{Practical:}
For some adjudications that SMEs perform (e.g.\ laboratory), we could
develop a system that infers\slash learns a SME's internal mental
model,\footnote{E.g.\ ``serum sodium is where LabChemTestName matches
  these 3 strings, or where LOINC is one of these 5 codes, except in
  these 20 cases\ldots{}.''} from the SME answering ``keep\slash
discard'' to database elements, with only slight further effort from
the SME. For the very most popular phenotypes, we could advertise
database counts to study coordinators, updated monthly perhaps.
Phenotypes could be linked back to specific clauses in a given version
of the research study protocol; any amendment to a critical part of
the protocol would trigger a need for an amendment to the
corresponding data process.

\paragraph{Scientific:}
I personally imagine keeping track of all analyses run on the data
set, starting even at the early exploratory stage of phenotyping. I
would imagine the same record-keeping attitude that one might have
toward a laboratory notebook in a basic bioscience lab, or toward a
patent book.\footnote{``Just as with biological materials, such code
  should be made available alongside results obtained using
  it\ldots{}. Because software support is far more burdensome than
  delivery of materials such as plasmids, this code may be accompanied
  by a disclaimer\ldots{}.'' \emph{Nature Methods} 11 (3): 211. March,
  2014.} When study results are published, will it be possible to run
the whole analysis with one click (at least within VA, where the data
resides)? If not, \emph{why not?}

\paragraph{VA Collaboration:}
VA would benefit greatly if the library were available across VA
nationally: if it made phenotypes \emph{available for reuse}, for the
purposes of other projects. Phenotyping is performed very commonly not
only for MVP studies, but for large VA Cooperative Studies Program
(CSP) trials---coordinated in Boston and at the other centers.
Furthermore, smaller, non-CSP research projects at single VA Medical
Centers would benefit, as would non-research efforts (quality and
business related).

From my personal perspective, MVP communicates well about phenotyping
with certain CSP and other studies based in Boston. Those
communications are relatively informal, however. We have made in my
opinion somewhat slow progress synchronizing efforts with VA groups
apart from the above. This may be because it is a time-consuming
proposition to share a large amount of history and accumulated
experience from one group to another and vice versa, to make processes
transparent enough for others to trust, and then to decide on a common
direction. Furthermore, after a ``merger,'' both sides are likely to
see that some of their work (sunk costs) does not get incorporated in
the final product.
