\maketitle

Motivation: VA data elements are not harmonized across stations.
\emph{Phenotype} is the term we use for a set of harmonized data
elements, or a higher order set built from many harmonized data
elements.\footnote{For example, 130 stations' ICD codes + labs $\to$
  harmonized ICD + labs $\to$ diabetes + neuropathy $\to$ diabetic
  nephropathy $\to$ which is a subset of diabetes with any
  microvascular complication $\to$ subset of diabetes with any
  complication at all, etc.}

\section{What I imagine for a phenotype library}

When a subject matter expert (SME), analyst, statistician, and/or data
pull engineer create a phenotype/adjudication, the result can be SQL
code that represents the SME's rules, or a public database table that
represents the enumerated list of included/excluded data items, or
even a statistical model of the likelihood of a patient having the
given phenotype. Ideally, a robust phenotype library should exist,
serving several functions.

(1) The library would make the products of each SME/data review
process \emph{available for viewing} by study coordinators or others,
with ``provenance'' (responsible SME and data extractor) clearly
noted, to allow study staff to trust a given phenotype. Make it easy
to browse an overview of all documents without having to drill down
into 99 different subfolders. (2) The library would make phenotypes
\emph{available for reuse}, for the purposes of other projects. (3)
The library would allow easy searches across phenotypes, to allow new
studies to discover what already exists. Very important to search
within document content. (4) The library would make phenotypes
\emph{available for renewal,} with their date of creation clearly
noted, because data warehouse elements may change over time. (5) The
library would document the rationale for decisions made by SME and
data pull engineers. Allow collaborative editing of a group of
documents. Audit/track all edits. Possibly link among documents. (6)
Should be available across VA nationally.

\section{Operationalizing the library}

I think a wiki serves \emph{some} of these requirements
well, especially search, and viewing provenance, documentation, and
rationale.\footnote{A wiki is simply a Web application which allows
  people to add, modify, or delete content in collaboration with
  others. Requirements 1, 3, and 5 all involve basically
  human-readable items with English sentences.} But I'm not sure
whether the current wiki is the best long-term solution. SharePoint
would work OK, except for the fact that its search feature does not
work at all.

A wiki does \emph{not} serve some of the functions as
well.\footnote{Specifically: reusing a phenotype, and renewing or modifying
a phenotype. These are more oriented toward machine-readable items.}
In my imagined ideal world, people would use Git or other source code
management software for this purpose. The main drawback is the
learning curve, so I don't know whether this is actually going to
happen. SQL/SAS code on the wiki is not the worst solution, even
though it's nonstandard. I strongly believe that SQL code cut/pasted
into an MS Word document will not be long-term viable, and the same
goes for ``e-mail your code to one person who will be in charge of
uploading/managing it.''

\marginnote{More about MediaWiki: MediaWiki is the software that makes Wikipedia run, but anyone can
install it to their Web server to create their own wiki. MediaWiki
uses its own markup language called wikitext. Templates avoid a
\emph{lot} of copy-pasting of wikicode. I'm more than happy to help
with creating templates and dealing with markup.}

\section{Timeline and goals}

\paragraph{Already built:}
A database space within CDW to store lists of adjudicated elements. A
SharePoint space for phenomics core to store some documentation. A
wiki system to store further documentation, allow for search, allow
collaborative editing with easy versioning, and help SharePoint
navigation. A very basic system to store source code (happens to be
the wiki).

\paragraph{Very short term (1--2 months):}
Decide on continuing with current wiki vs.\ SharePoint vs.\ a combination vs.\ some other
solution.\footnote{This depends on fixing access to the wiki, or
  fixing the search function within SharePoint.} Organize the browsing
function of the wiki (or other solution) to the specs of the phenomics
core (Anne \& I discussed this in past).

\paragraph{Long term (1 year +):}
Agree on and possibly train on a more robust source code control
system (or failing that, design the wiki to do the best we can). Agree
on best practices for elements needed to document a
phenotype.\footnote{Who built this, when, using what process, for what
  chief purpose/study/intent, why did they make the choices they made,
  etc.} Document at least one phenotype using these practices, to
serve as an exemplar for others. Develop a system to advertise what is
in the process of being built (not just completed tasks).

\paragraph{Even longer term:}
Have a system that infers a SME's internal mental
model,\footnote{E.g.\ ``serum sodium is where LabChemTestName matches
  the following 3 text strings, where Topography matches the following
  2 strings, or where LOINC is in the following set of 5 elements,
  except in the following 20 cases which have probably erroneous
  LOINCs or TestNames\ldots{}.''} from the SME answering
``keep/discard'' to CDW elements, with only slight further effort from
the SME.\footnote{Nate has some ideas about how to approach this, e.g.\ a
system that learns classification trees that the SME can select/edit
at a high level.}

\section{Questions for the group:}

Do you agree with my list of requirements? Does a wiki fit the bill?
Is the wiki the right place for SQL code? What training on the wiki do
you want? What should be captured about each algorithm?
