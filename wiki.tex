\section{What I imagine for phenotype library}

Motivation: (a) VA data elements are not harmonized across stations,
and that (b) phenotypes do this harmonization and also build low level
phenotypes into higher order phenotypes.\footnote{For example, 130
  stations ICD codes + labs + ??? $\to$ harmonized ICD + labs + ???
  $\to$ diabetes + neuropathy $\to$ diabetic nephropathy $\to$ which
  is a subset of diabetes with any microvascular complication $\to$
  subset of diabetes with any complication at all, etc.}

To start the process of defining a new phenotype, a subject matter
expert (SME) works with the data pull team to search for candidate
items that may contribute to the phenotype in question. The SME
reviews the list that is retrieved, generating either a general rule
to specify which items match the phenotype, or an enumerated list of
which items match the phenotype. The data pull team then generates SQL
code that represents the SME's rules, or a public database table that
represents the enumerated list of data items, or even a statistical
model of the likelihood of a patient having the given phenotype.

Ideally, a robust phenotype library should exist, serving several
functions. (1) The library would make the products of each SME/data
review process \emph{available for viewing} by study coordinators or
others, with ``provenance'' (responsible SME and data extractor)
clearly noted, to allow study staff to trust a given phenotype. (2)
The library would make phenotypes \emph{available for reuse}, for the
purposes of other projects. (3) The library would allow easy searches
across phenotypes, to allow new studies to discover what already
exists. (4) The library would make phenotypes \emph{available for
  renewal,} with their date of creation clearly noted, because data
warehouse elements may change over time. (5) The library would
document the rationale for decisions made by SME and data pull
engineers.%\footnote{The basic idea is that the methods of science
%  should be documented well enough to be reproducible---in other
%  words, ``show your work.'' For our type of science, \emph{code is
%    method.} See also http://sciencecodemanifesto.org}

\section{Problem/niche}

The Precision Oncology Project and the Point of Care Trial project
rely in part on a workflow that goes roughly as follows. \emph{First,}
the subject matter expert knows that we want to track the effect of
drug $x$ on (for example) serum sodium. The SME attempts to
operationalize the concept of serum sodium, suggesting a list of terms
to be searched for in a field (e.g.\ \texttt{LabChemTestName}) of CDW.
\emph{Second,} the data pull team returns a list of lab tests matching
these search terms.\footnote{The list sent to the SME is often an
  Excel file. Data extractor probably generates SQL code in the
  process.} \emph{Third,} the SME reviews the list of tests and
decides (adjudicates) which items truly match the concept. The SME
returns either a refined general rule to specify which items match the
concept, or an enumerated list of which items match the
concept.\footnote{So far I return this adjudication to Beth in the
  form of an edited Excel file.} \emph{Fourth,} the data pull team
creates a query that represents this adjudication.\footnote{probably
  generating refined SQL code.} The clinical SME may give formal
approval or ``sign off'' on the data pull at step 3, or possibly on
the results of step 4.


\section{Recent wiki changes} 

Started to use as of May 2014 on vhabosapp8. adjudications as of oct
30, starting with radiology note titles, sodium, magnesium, AST, ALT,
POP surgical procedures.

Templates avoid a \emph{lot} of copy-pasting of wikicode.

\section{Suggestions for you all in future}

Look at the wiki. Make a user account. Edit things (be bold). Ask if
you need help.

\section{Questions for the group}

\begin{itemize}

\item What should we call the deliverable that the data pull expert
  and the SME create in collaboration?\footnote{Thoughts: data
    model, concept model, algorithm, adjudication, library, phenotype,
    phenotype model, study data dictionary.}

\item Not much complete SQL is on the wiki currently. Is the wiki the
  right place for SQL code? Or should the wiki merely have a pointer
  to a source control repository?

\item What training on the wiki do you want?

\item Do you want an e-mail every time a new algorithm is uploaded?

\item What should be captured about each algorithm?\footnote{Currently
  caputured on basic algorithm pages on wiki: algorithm version, SQL
  statement, SME name, approval date. On the more detailed wiki form
  we have the following fields: lab name, sample source (body site),
  date created, data source, SQL search terms used, clinical
  adjudication list (link to Excel file), adjudicator name, SQL data
  extractor name, extracted data location, content of extracted data,
  extraction verified by:, SQL extraction code.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Further reading about MediaWiki and our server}

``A wiki is a Web application which allows people to add, modify, or
delete content in collaboration with
others.''\footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki} MediaWiki is the
software that makes Wikipedia run, but anyone can install it to their
Web server to create their own wiki. MediaWiki uses its own markup
language called wikitext.
